# LectureSorter
Many professors allow you to record their lectures, which is very useful when you have to review recent material. However, keeping everything in one directory might cause a big mess and makes it quite difficult to find specific recording. Of course, you can sort it manually, which is easy but very time-comsuming. Fortunately, there's a simple application in Java that can do it for you.

# ToDo
- refactor existing methods 
- change collecting data method
